-> Home / About me:
A little explanation about who I am.
-> Portfolio:
A list of projects I developed. With explanation and skills used.
-> Skills / Education or resume?
A list of skills and the jobs I did.
I'd like to maintain the skills in a database. Rather then having to update them manually
-> Say Hello:
A contact page

I'd prefer multiple pages instead of a one pager.

I'd prefer to use the TALL Stack. So for Front-end Tailwind/Alpine/LiveWire.
